				Random coil chemical sfhits from protein sequence
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Polypeptide backbone chemical shifts were proven powerful descriptors of local dynamic deviations from the "random coil" state toward canonical types of secondary structure. These digressions, in turn, can be connected to functional or dysfunctional protein states, for example, in adaptive molecular recognition and protein aggregation. Here we describe a first inventory of IDP backbone (15)N, (1)H(N), (1)H(α), (13)C(O), (13)C(β), and (13)C(α) chemical shifts using data obtained for a set of 14 proteins of unrelated sequence and function. The ncIDP prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that obtained with libraries for small peptides or "coil" regions of folded proteins.
